# Novel Coronavirus, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bat

If you&#39;ve communicated with a human in the last few weeks, chances are you&#39;ve heard about the novel coronavirus. The virus is sometimes referred to as the Wuhan virus, after the the Chinese city identified as the epicenter of the virus, possibly due to the consumption of infected bat meat. In the medical literature, it is referred to as 2019-nCoV.

You may have read that President Xi Jinping is using the vast powers of the Chinese security state to stop the dissemination of vital information; you may have read that the World Health Organization has declared a global emergency. Given the way the news media and your weird uncle on Facebook talk about it, you may have come to believe the end times are fast approaching.

What&#39;s happening in China is, without a doubt, disturbing. But if you live outside the borders of the PRC, chances are the worst symptom you&#39;ll ever experience from the coronavirus is the paranoia you&#39;re experiencing now.

So, how deadly is this virus exactly?

As this chart indicates, not very. In China, there are currently around 37198 confirmed cases, and 811 deaths. 811 deaths is, undoubtedly, tragic. But the mortality is only around 2% -- for some perspective, influenza mortality in the United States in the 2017-2018 season was around 7.5% ([https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm)). And outside of mainland China?

There have been 351 total cases of novel coronavirus outside of mainland China so far, and only two deaths. That mortality is about half a percent.

The most important takeaway from this is that unless something changes in a big way, this is not as apocalyptic as your preferred news organization is warning. But in poring over this data, I did find something else I believe to be in the public interest. This chart shows all the regions outside of China with a significant number of infected inhabitants -- I arbitrarily defined significance as greater than ten cases.

At 60 souls, the number of infected aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, quarantined off the coast of Japan, exceeds that of any other nation barring China, and by no small margin. And it&#39;s not slowing down--by the time you read this, this number may have doubled, or even tripled. There have been no casualties aboard the Diamond Princess as of yet.

For now, novel coronavirus as a globally devastating pandemic does not appear to be an imminent danger. Cruise liners, however, are another story.
